# Guessing-Game

Welcome to the guessing game. It's my first piece of self written python code that's not a Machine Learning Jupyter Notebook in Kaggle. So feedback is more than welcome.

**Goal of this guessing game**: Guess a random number between 0 and 10.

We save the number of attempts needed to guess the number as well as the high score with the lowest attempts needed.

Help for user: showing a message if the random number is lower or higher than the user input.

We validate the following user inputs:
* User Name has characters
* "Yes" or "No" for starting a play
* user input is an integer AND in range between 0 and 10
* "Yes" or "No" for starting the next round
